            <hr class="w-75 mx-auto">
            <div class="row">

                <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-5">
                    <p>Fender Musical Instruments Corporation is the world’s foremost manufacturer of guitars, basses,
                        amplifiers and related equipment. <br>

                        With an illustrious history dating back to 1946, Fender has touched and transformed music
                        worldwide and in nearly every genre: rock ‘n’ roll, country and western, jazz, rhythm and blues,
                        and many others. Everyone from beginners and hobbyists to the world’s most acclaimed artists and
                        performers have used Fender instruments and amps, and legendary Fender instruments such as the
                        Telecaster® and Stratocaster® guitars and Precision® and Jazz® bass guitars are universally
                        acclaimed as design classics.<br>

                        In the 1940s, southern California inventor Leo Fender realized that he could improve on the
                        amplified hollow-body instruments of the day by using an innovative and rather simple solid-body
                        electric guitar design. Further, he realized that he could streamline the process of building
                        them.<br>

                        In 1951 he introduced a prototype solid-body instrument that would eventually be called the
                        Telecaster® guitar. The Tele®, as it was often called then and still is today, was the first
                        solid-body Spanish-style electric guitar to be commercially mass-produced.
                        <br>
                        That same year, Fender introduced a revolutionary new invention—the Precision Bass guitar. It
                        was played like a guitar and had frets so that it could be played with “precision,” and it could
                        be amplified, thus liberating bassists from unwieldy and increasingly difficult-to-hear acoustic
                        basses.<br>

                        These two historic instruments laid the foundation for a new kind of group and a revolution in
                        popular music—what we know today as the modern rock combo. As opposed to the “big bands” of the
                        era, electric Fender instruments made it possible for smaller groups of musicians to get
                        together and be heard.<br>

                        The Stratocaster first appeared in 1954, incorporating many design innovations based on feedback
                        from professional musicians, Fender staff and Leo Fender himself. Its third single-coil pickup
                        offered more tonal possibilities, its sleekly contoured body made it more comfortable, and its
                        double cutaway design made access to upper registers much easier.
                        <br>
                        Most important, however, was the addition of the new Fender vibrato (or “tremolo”) bridge, an
                        innovation originally intended to let guitarists bend strings, thus achieving the pedal
                        steel-like sound so popular among country music artists of the day.
                        <br>
                        Nobody could have foreseen then how the Stratocaster would go on to revolutionize popular music.
                        Essentially unchanged since its 1954 debut, it is the most popular and influential electric
                        guitar ever, and players at all levels and in all genres continue to rely on its sound,
                        playability and versatility to this day.
                        <br>
                        Leo Fender himself remained an immensely creative force over the next decade, introducing many
                        classic instrument and amplifier designs, including the Jazz Bass® guitar, the Jaguar® and
                        Jazzmaster® guitars and the Twin Reverb® amplifier.
                        <br>
                        Because of poor health, Leo Fender sold the company to CBS in 1965. Fender Musical Instruments
                        experienced tremendous growth over the next 20 years, but a lack of commitment and real
                        understanding of music and musicians by CBS gradually became apparent.

                    <p>
                        To “re-invent” Fender, CBS recruited new management in 1981. William Schultz became company
                        president, supported by associate William Mendello. Their 5-year business plan was based on
                        increasing Fender’s marketplace presence with dramatic quality improvement and greater
                        commitment to research and development.
                        <br>
                        When CBS shed its non-broadcast media businesses in the 1980s, a group of employees and
                        investors led by Schultz bought Fender from CBS in 1985. The sale put the Fender name back into
                        the hands of a small group of dedicated people committed to creating the world’s best guitars
                        and amplifiers.
                        <br>
                        The new Fender Musical Instruments Corporation (FMIC) had to start from scratch—there were no
                        buildings or machinery included in the sale. Among other things, FMIC purchased the name,
                        intellectual property and some leftover parts. Supported by a core group of loyal employees,
                        dealers and suppliers (some of whom had been with the company since Leo Fender founded it),
                        Schultz and his colleagues set out to rebuild an American icon.
                        <br>
                        The new Fender initially imported its guitars from offshore manufacturers with proven ability to
                        produce affordable and viable instruments, but the move toward greater quality control soon led
                        to the establishment in 1985 of Fender’s flagship U.S. factory in Corona, Calif. A second modern
                        manufacturing facility opened in 1987 in Ensenada, Mexico.
                        <br>
                        Also in 1987, the renowned Fender Custom Shop opened at the Corona facility, creating dream
                        instruments for professional guitarists and guitar enthusiasts. Fender had always recognized the
                        importance of an open-door policy for professional musicians, accommodating their requests for
                        specific features on an individual basis. The Fender Custom Shop has since become known
                        worldwide and industry-wide as the pinnacle of craftsmanship and sheer instrumental artistry.
                        <br>
                        FMIC moved its corporate headquarters from Corona to Scottsdale, Ariz., in 1991. From there,
                        Fender coordinates its administration, marketing, advertising, sales and export operations in
                        the United States and its international satellite facilities in England, France, Germany, Japan,
                        Mexico, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden. Schultz retired in 2005, and Mendello became CEO.
                        <br>
                        Since its founding, FMIC has grown to be one of the world's leading marketers, manufacturers,
                        and distributors of musical instruments. It manufactures and distributes everything guitarists
                        and bassists need, from instruments, amplifiers, strings and accessories to professional audio
                        products. Fender became one of the world leaders by defining the sounds we hear, by meeting the
                        needs of musicians, by creating quality products and by backing them up with service and
                        stability. As FMIC forges into the 21st century, its management strives to maintain Fender’s
                        status through a combination of business acumen and love for music.
                        <br>
                        Corporate headquarters is located in Scottsdale, Ariz., U.S.A., with manufacturing headquarters
                        and the Fender Custom Shop in Corona, Calif. FMIC markets using the brand names Fender®,
                        Squier®, Charvel®, Gretsch®, Jackson®, and EVH®.
